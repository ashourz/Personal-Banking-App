# My Personal Banking App
Personal banking application to view accounts and account details hosted on cloud.

# Project Assignment
- Build an app where you can see the list of your banking and card accounts (Accounts View). Please use the attached base project to add your code.
- The list on Accounts View is vertically scrollable. When user touch one of the items, the app should take them to next page (Detail View) where users can see the details.
- The user can touch either the physical Done button or the back arrow at the top left corner on Detail View to go back to the Accounts View.
- For each screen, display the Name on Toolbar.
